I tried to send notifications to myself about the cat I have with my roommate called Mary. She is a chubby cat and is always hungry. I want to use this notification to help me better connect with her and attend to her needs. 
### Problems
- adding the env file to the droplet.
- touch .env does not work. It requires a name.
